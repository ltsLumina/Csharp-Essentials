# Csharp-Essentials
A collection of my C# Essentials.

## Features:
* Quick keyboard shortcuts for damaging, healing and killing the player, as well as reloading the scene.
* A async task method that allows you to invoke an action after a delay, asynchronously.
* A read-only attribute that allows you to make SerializedFields readonly. (Done by using the tag [ReadOnly] next to a field)

##
* I update this whenever I feel like it.
